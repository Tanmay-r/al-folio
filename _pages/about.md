Hello! :wave:

I am a researcher and a software engineer. I love coming up with novel solutions to challenging problems and I love helping computers understand the real-world. That is why, I spend most of my time on creating virtual agents and synthetic datasets and using them train a computer, robot, or even an autonomous vehicle to detect objects and various characteristics of humans.
